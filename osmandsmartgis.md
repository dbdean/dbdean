# OpenStreetMap and Machine Learning

## OpenStreetMap, Community and Evangelism

I've been an [OpenStreetMap][osm] [member][osmprofile] since 2007, and
was responsible for a lot of the original mapping and social events in
Brisbane, Australia.

I have organised around 25 [Brisbane Mapping Events][events] over the
past decade. I have also evangelized OpenStreetMap to universities and
local community groups on many occasions, such as this recent
[Missing Maps][mmaps] Presentation in October 2017:

If you need to be convinced why OpenStreetMap is a force for good
around the world, please watch this great video:

## Machine Learning and GIS - Object Detection from Aerial Imagery

These days, I'm mapping very seriously, but I'm also starting a focus
on side projects for AI and machine-learning for GIS applications to
help the OpenStreetMap community.

I have already done some work in this space, back in 2011, where I
worked with [Felix Guo][felix] to develop a dataset based on high-resolution
aerial imagery from [NearMap][nearmap] (which was CC-licensed at the time) and
OpenStreetMap ground truth. We published our findings at the [2011
Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA)][dicta2011] conference:

> X. Guo, **D. Dean**, S. Denman, C. Fookes and S. Sridharan,
> "[Evaluating Automatic Road Detection across a Large Aerial Imagery
> Collection][roaddetectpaper]," *2011 International Conference on Digital Image Computing:
> Techniques and Applications*, Noosa, QLD, 2011, pp. 140-145.

The paper can be downloaded [here][roaddetectpaper], and the slides from our
presentation can be viewed below:

Unfortunately, due to lack of interest, the university has not made
the database available, and due to newer data in this space, it is
unlikely to happen moving forward.

## Machine Learning for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team

I'm currently doing open-source development work on the
[SkyNet project][skynet] with [Development Seed][devseed], focusing on
approaches that can help the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team][hot] to
more efficiently map buildings, roads, and other features for
disadvantaged populations across the world.
