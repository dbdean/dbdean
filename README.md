# About me

I'm a machine learning researcher and software engineer with 12+ years
of experience in developing and improving state-of-the art
machine-learning research algorithms and turning them into useful,
reusable code that can make life easier for researchers, software
engineers, and everyone else!

## Things I'm doing

[**OpenStreetMap and Smart-GIS**][osmandsmartgis]: I've been an
[OpenStreetMap][osm] [member][osmprofile] since 2007, and was
responsible for a lot of the original mapping and social events in
Brisbane, Australia. I want to get more into AI and machine-learning
for GIS applications to help the OpenStreetMap community, and would
love to be able to be paid to work in this space!

**Teaching**: I have enjoyed supervising 7 PhD students over the past
7 years, and have done occasional seasonal academic work for QUT over
that time.

I have just started with the University of Queensland develop an
exciting new [Masters of Data Science][MDataSc], and I am looking
forward to helping in the training of professional data scientists.

I have recently started mentoring with
[CoderDojo Brisbane][coderdojo], and helping kids get excited about
coding is pretty awesome.

**Acoustic sleep diagnostics**: I have recently done some work with an exciting
start-up, [Wink Health][wink], to help people track and measure their
sleep quality through innovative acoustic analysis.

[**Audio-visual speech**][avspeech]: I have been working with audio-visual
speech since 2004, and love showing that visual information is almost
always complementary to acoustic over a wide range of applications.

**Speaker recognition and diarisation**: A large part of my
post-doctoral experience since completing my PhD in 2008 has focused
on conducting research, development and commercialisation of state of
the art speaker recognition and diarisation research.
