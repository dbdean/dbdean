# About me

I'm a machine learning researcher and software engineer with 12+ years
of experience in developing and improving state-of-the art
machine-learning research algorithms and turning them into useful,
reusable code that can make life easier for researchers, software
engineers, and everyone else!

## I do machine learning for TAFE NSW 

I've recently started a new position in [Armidale][armidale], with TAFE Digital NSW as a machine learning specialist.
We will be working with the new TAFE Digital organisation within TAFE NSW to consolidate online learning across the organisation,
and ensure that we can get the best outcomes for students with learning analytics and machine learning.

## I run OpenStreetMap events

When I was still in Brisbane, I ran local events for the OpenStreetMap community.
So, if you came here looking for OpenStreetMap events in Brisbane, please
go have a look at the [Brisbane Events Page][bneevents] on the OSM Wiki, or my
[EventBrite][ev] page. 

I hope to start up similar events in Armidale soon!

[**OpenStreetMap and Smart-GIS**][osmandsmartgis]: I've been an
[OpenStreetMap][osm] [member][osmprofile] since 2007, and was
responsible for a lot of the original mapping and social events in
Brisbane, Australia. I want to get more into AI and machine-learning
for GIS applications to help the OpenStreetMap community.

## I teach

I have enjoyed supervising 7 PhD students over the past
7 years, and have done occasional seasonal academic work over
that time as well.

Throughout 2017, I worked with the University of Queensland developing an
exciting new [Masters of Data Science][MDataSc], and I enjoyed
developing datasets and teaching material that helps in the training
of future professional data scientists.

I have also done some mentoring with [CoderDojo Brisbane][coderdojo],
and helping kids get excited about coding is pretty awesome.

## I do medical machine learning

I have recently done some machine-learning 
consultation work with two exciting medical machine-learning start-ups, 
[Wink Health][wink] in California, and [M3dicine][stethee] in Brisbane. 
It's great to be able to help medical professionals and the general population
to get access to improved health care through innovative signal processing
and machine learning.

## I am a speech researcher

I have been working with [audio-visual speech][avspeech] since 2004,
and loved showing that visual information is almost always
complementary to acoustic over a wide range of applications.

**Speaker recognition and diarisation**: A large part of my
post-doctoral experience since completing my PhD in 2008 has focused
on conducting research, development and commercialisation of state of
the art speaker recognition and diarisation research.

## I have publications

As of November 2017, I have 771 citations across more than 80 publications,
with 24 publications having more than 10 citations, and a h-index
of 14. More details, and a full list of publications can be found on
my [Google Scholar profile][scholar].
